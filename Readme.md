The two datasets contain two different characteristics which are physico-chemical and sensorial of two different wines (red and white), the product is called "Vinho Verde". The data were taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

There are 1599 samples of red wine and 4898 samples of white wine in the data sets. Each wine sample (row) has the following characteristics (columns):

1.) Fixed acidity
2.) Volatile acidity
3.) Citric acid
4.) Residual sugar
5.) Chlorides
6.) Free sulfur dioxide
7.) Total sulfur dioxide
8.) Density
9.) pH
10.) Sulphates
11.) Alcohol
12.) Quality (score between 0 and 10)

The study context is to try different predictive algorithms on the data and examine the results.
